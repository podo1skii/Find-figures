Find figures
=============
### Task:

There is a graphic file containing images of geometric shapes of 3 types (circle, square, triangle). The figures are uniformly painted over and arranged on a uniform background. The figures do not intersect with each other. The size of the figures may be different.
Print the number of figures of each type.

### Program:

In ```filename``` variable must be written full path to image.

I use the OpenCV library for processing image, finding contours and approximate it.
